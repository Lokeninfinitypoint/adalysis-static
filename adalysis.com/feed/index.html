<a style="display: inline-block;" href="#section17">What match type should you use?</a></p>
</div>
<h2 id="section1">About the data</h2>
<p>We analyzed data from 16,825 search campaigns over three months, focusing on what most advertisers experience with non-brand keywords.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand profile campaigns were removed from the study. This type of campaign generally has very high CTRs, conversion rates, and ROAS. They behave differently from non-brand campaigns and would skew all results upwards.</li>
<li>Campaigns with anomalous data were also excluded. Examples include campaigns with thousands of conversions at $0.05 CPAs, ROAS in the millions, average revenue per conversion of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and conversion rates under 0.005% with tens of thousands of clicks.</li>
<li>Campaigns without conversion data were removed.</li>
<li>Campaigns that represented a significant portion of the total dataset were also excluded. This prevents individual advertisers from skewing the overall results.</li>
<li>All currencies were converted to USD using the latest exchange rates.</li>
<li>The data was first aggregated across all campaigns for each segment (match type, bid method, and spend levels), and then the final metrics were calculated. We didn&#8217;t use averages of averages.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section2">Match type definitions</h2>
<p><strong>Exact match</strong><br />
The search term’s intent must be closely related to your keyword. The word order or spelling doesn&#8217;t matter. Google generally matches these keywords to suitable search terms well, with some notable exceptions, such as matching to other brands.</p>
<p><strong>Phrase match</strong><br />
The search term must include your overall keyword’s meaning, but additional ideas can be included. For example, the phrase match keyword <em>plumber</em> would match to <em>cheap plumber</em> or <em>plumber phone number</em>. Google&#8217;s matching for phrase match keywords is very inconsistent from account to account. We’ll cover this in more detail below.</p>
<p><strong>Broad match</strong><br />
These keywords match to similar search terms. ‘Similar’ is a term that Google uses, and from a marketer&#8217;s perspective, the actual closeness of these search terms has ebbed and flowed over the years. Some years, terms like <em>coal</em> match to <em>apple iphone charger</em>. In other years, Google has been more specific.</p>
<p>The main benefit of broad match is that Google uses additional signals for its automated bidding, such as the user’s previous search history. Google hasn’t made this bidding technology available to any other match types.</p>
<h2 id="section3">Aggregate performance by match type</h2>
<p>We established a baseline by aggregating all the data across every bid method. This shows how each match type performs at a high level.</p>
<p>Exact match is the most commonly used match type, followed by phrase, and then broad. However, exact match keywords have the lowest number of impressions of any match type. This is expected, given the more restrictive matching rules for this type.</p>
<p>While exact and phrase are used more frequently than broad match, the distribution of clicks is nearly equal across all three match types.</p>
<p><strong><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11962 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Pie-Chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Pie-Chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Pie-Chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Pie-Chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Pie-Chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Pie-Chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Pie-Chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficiency is where exact match shines.</span> It delivers higher CTRs, conversion rates, and ROAS while maintaining lower CPAs than both phrase and broad match.</p>
<p>Phrase match presents an interesting paradox. Despite having both higher CTRs and conversion rates than broad match, it actually delivers worse CPAs and ROAS. Our analysis suggests this is because bids are generally set too high for phrase match.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11961 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Bar-Chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Bar-Chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Bar-Chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Bar-Chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Bar-Chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Bar-Chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/All-Data_-Bar-Chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>This could be a weakness in Google’s automated bidding, as broad match uses bid signals unavailable to phrase.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll address phrase match in detail near the end of the analysis, but next, let’s look at the data by bid method.</p>
<h1 id="section4">Ecommerce bidding: Focusing on conversion values</h1>
<p>Ecommerce companies focus on revenue and ROAS, relying primarily on Max Conversion Value or Target ROAS bidding.</p>
<p>With these bid methods, Google prioritizes revenue and ROAS over CPA. Therefore, our analysis will focus on revenue-based metrics.</p>
<h2 id="section5">Max Conversion Value bidding</h2>
<p>The goal of Max Conversion Value is to maximize your campaign revenue. ROAS isn’t a consideration for bid purposes.</p>
<p>This bid method is used primarily by small ecommerce companies. The vast majority of larger ecommerce advertisers use Target ROAS, along with significantly larger budgets.</p>
<h3>Broad match delivers higher revenue per conversion</h3>
<p>Max Conversion Value is the only bid method where each match type has a similar number of keywords.</p>
<p>Comparing the percentage of keywords used to their impressions and conversions, all the match types pull their weight. However, broad match made up 32% of keywords, 39% of impressions, 34% of revenue, but only 25% of conversions. That means each broad match conversion leads to more revenue than the other match types.</p>
<p><strong> <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11942 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-pie-chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-pie-chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-pie-chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-pie-chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-pie-chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-pie-chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-pie-chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></strong></p>
<h3>Broad match delivers higher ROAS despite higher CPA</h3>
<p>With Max Conversion Value bidding, broad match had a significantly higher CPA than exact match, but it also had a higher ROAS. You rarely see these two facts together since a high CPA usually means a poor ROAS.</p>
<p>Google appears to find broad match search terms with a low conversion rate. However, if you accumulate enough cheap clicks and some of those users make a purchase, they can add up to a healthy ROAS.</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11941 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-bar-chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-bar-chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-bar-chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-bar-chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-bar-chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-bar-chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversion-Value_-bar-chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></strong></p>
<p>Only Google has the data to validate this strategy. While this study supports advertiser concerns that broad match generates lower-quality clicks, this approach can still deliver a positive ROAS. There simply need to be enough cheap clicks to offset lower conversion rates.</p>
<h3>Exact match for single products, broad match for shopping sprees</h3>
<p>One way to frame the analysis is around this data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exact match is 40% of conversions and 31% of revenue</li>
<li>Broad match is 25% of conversions and 34% of revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>The average checkout amount for broad match is higher than exact match.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertisers use exact match because they know what the user wants, and the customers are buying that single product. These keywords have more competition, leading to low CPAs, high conversion rates, and low checkout amounts. For known commodities, you need exact match or you’ll lose these sales to the competition.</span></p>
<p>Users who are unsure of their needs or are simply online shopping are triggering broad match keywords. These users aren’t searching for a single product, but rather buying multiple items, which is why the checkout values are higher.</p>
<h3>Phrase match struggles with Max Conversion Value</h3>
<p>Phrase match has the highest CPA and lowest ROAS. In fact, we’ll see that phrase match has a higher conversion rate than broad match, but worse CPAs and ROAS for many bid methods.</p>
<p>Google bidding appears to be less effective for phrase match keywords. We’ve noticed similar examples to the poor-quality matching seen with broad match back in the 2010s.</p>
<p>Google has significantly expanded the search terms that phrase match keywords can match to. However, since the bid signals used for broad match aren’t applied to phrase match, the bids are leading to poor results.</p>
<p>Most advertisers using Max Conversion Value bidding have relatively few conversions, resulting in less data for Google’s system. This means we can’t recommend phrase match for Max Conversion Value.</p>
<p>While we’re still not ready to walk away from exact match keywords, overall, broad match is performing well with Max Conversion Value bidding. If you aren’t using that match type, it&#8217;s worth trying for some of your keywords.</p>
<h3>Match type recommendations for Max Conversion Value</h3>
<p>Start with exact match keywords to capture buyers who know what they want. If you can’t spend your entire budget on exact match, add your top keywords and search terms as broad match.</p>
<p>What we don’t know is the long-term revenue, repeat buyer behavior, or average returns by match type. This is internal data you should combine with your match type usage.</p>
<p>Just remember, Max Conversion Value bidding is primarily used by smaller accounts. If you have a larger budget, you’ll want to review the Target ROAS section.</p>
<h2 id="section6">Target ROAS bidding</h2>
<p>With Target ROAS, Google sets bids to try to meet your ROAS goals. Target ROAS bidding is generally used by three sets of advertisers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mid-sized and larger ecommerce companies</li>
<li>Companies with online checkouts (website hosting, travel, etc.)</li>
<li>Lead gen companies<br />
◦   Some assign different conversion values to each lead type<br />
◦   Others assign values to each lead stage and push the value for each stage back to Google (ie. lead, MQL, SQL, sale)</li>
</ul>
<p>Companies employing Target ROAS bidding generally have more sophisticated ad group structures and campaign setups than those using Max Conversion Value.</p>
<h3>ROAS consistency across match types</h3>
<p>The data shows a heavy reliance on exact match, which makes up 55% of keywords. When we review efficiency, exact match accounts for 27% of impressions and 40% of conversions, but only 30% of revenue. Exact match converts well, but for low checkout amounts.</p>
<p>This is one of the few bid methods where phrase match shines. It makes up 24% of conversions and 35% of revenue. The difference in phrase match between Target ROAS and Max Conversion Value bidding is startling.</p>
<p>The campaigns that use Target ROAS are generally much larger than those using Max Conversion Value. This means Google’s automated systems have more data for setting bids.</p>
<p>We also see fewer extremely poor search terms for phrase match keywords when using Target ROAS compared to Max Conversion Value. Broad match keywords show ads for a lot of search terms: 25% of keywords, but 46% of impressions. However, the match type holds its own with 35% of conversions and 35% of revenue.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11952 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-pie-chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-pie-chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-pie-chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-pie-chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-pie-chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-pie-chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-pie-chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>It’s easy to see why large advertisers prefer exact match. It has the highest CTR by a wide margin, the best conversion rate, the lowest CPA, and the highest ROAS.</p>
<p>However, the other match types have comparable ROAS numbers. Google is doing well at delivering on your ROAS goals with every match type.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11978 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-bar-chart_v2-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-bar-chart_v2-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-bar-chart_v2-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-bar-chart_v2-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-bar-chart_v2-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-bar-chart_v2-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS_-bar-chart_v2-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3>Exact match for acquisition, phrase match for revenue</h3>
<p>Success metrics for ecommerce companies include repeat buyers and lifetime visitor values. Therefore, a common goal is to add buyers to your CRM system, so you can market to them in additional ways. Since exact match has the lowest CPA, it will get more buyers than the other match types into your CRM.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the highest checkout amounts come from phrase match keywords. Once again, the CPAs are extremely high compared to the other match types. Its ROAS is slightly higher than broad match, even with a very high cost per conversion. Phrase match’s conversion amounts compared to revenue amounts show that most of the online shoppers with large carts are matching to phrase keywords.</p>
<p>It appears that Google initially expands phrase match keywords to a wide range of search terms. As those keywords accumulate conversion data, Google gets better at bidding and deciding which search terms to bid on. Phrase match ends up with a nice ROAS.</p>
<p>Many larger cart queries that trigger broad match keywords in Max Conversion Value are captured by phrase terms for Target ROAS bidding.</p>
<p>Since broad match can use additional bid signals, it’s showing for fewer questionable queries, making it also a profitable match type to use with Target ROAS bidding. Overall, Target ROAS is a very good bid method for high-volume accounts.</p>
<h3>Match type recommendations for Target ROAS</h3>
<p>Start with exact match keywords. If you can’t spend your entire budget on exact match, add your top keywords and search terms as phrase match. If you have additional budget or want more volume, then add the broad match versions of your keywords.</p>
<h2 id="section7">Target ROAS with top products &amp; brand keywords</h2>
<p>For this study, we removed brand-profile campaigns to focus on typical advertiser data. Brand campaigns generally have very high CTRs, conversion rates, and ROAS.</p>
<p>However, some ecommerce companies do achieve 2000% ROAS on non-brand keywords or 35% conversion rates. This section shows the complete picture for Target ROAS bidding.</p>
<p>We included these high-performing campaigns while still excluding anomalies (like $1 million average checkouts or 100,000% ROAS campaigns).</p>
<p>The overall percentage of keywords used and conversion-to-revenue ratios remain similar to non-brand Target ROAS data by match type.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11950 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-pie-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-pie-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-pie-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-pie-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-pie-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-pie-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-pie-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The metrics reveal significant differences. Exact match has over double the click-through rates of other match types. While all match types see improved conversion rates, exact match pulls further ahead.</p>
<p>For ROAS, exact match dominates with 615% versus 341% for broad match.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11979 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-bar_v2-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-bar_v2-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-bar_v2-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-bar_v2-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-bar_v2-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-bar_v2-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-ROAS-with-Brand-Terms_-bar_v2-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>These campaigns contribute a significant amount of data to the analysis. Despite this, phrase match still has a worse CPA than broad match, and only slightly higher ROAS.</p>
<p>These numbers showcase the power of exact match, even with all the signals Google can use for broad match bidding.</p>
<h3>Match type recommendations for Target ROAS for brand and top keywords</h3>
<p>Start with exact match keywords and spend as much as you can on this match type. If you can’t spend your entire budget on exact match, then you can use a mixture of phrase and broad match.</p>
<p>Phrase match will accumulate more clicks, allowing your remarketing audiences to grow. Broad match has a slightly lower ROAS and a lower CPA, so you&#8217;ll get more customers into your loyalty programs. Using a combination of phase and broad match should produce the best results for this bid method.</p>
<h1 id="section8">Lead gen bidding: Focusing on conversions</h1>
<p>Lead generation companies focus on achieving the highest possible conversions or the lowest cost per conversion. Therefore, CPA and conversion rates are the biggest focuses.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve included ROAS numbers for reference, but many companies use lead quality estimates or assign random values. Spot checks showed that most advertisers simply use a conversion value of 1.</p>
<p>Conversion count was the most significant difference in ROAS across many accounts. Companies choosing to count duplicate leads as conversions had the highest ROAS.</p>
<h2 id="section9">Max Conversion bidding</h2>
<p>Max Conversion focuses on capturing the most conversions regardless of CPA. Target CPA often doesn’t work well if you don’t have a lot of data. So while cost per conversion is important, Max Conversion bidding is usually the fallback bid method.</p>
<p>The vast majority of advertisers using this bid method are small to mid-sized lead gen companies. Campaign budgets are generally under $10k per month, and budgets under $5k are very common.</p>
<p>Some small ecommerce companies with huge variances in checkout values also use this method, as their ROAS numbers by keywords are too variable for Google to bid consistently.</p>
<h3>Exact, then phrase, then broad</h3>
<p>Once again, we see a huge reliance on exact match. It makes up 54% of all keywords, followed by phrase, and then broad match. Looking at the efficiency of each impression, it&#8217;s clear why exact is so commonly used: it captures 23% of impressions but 32% of conversions.</p>
<p>Phrase and broad aren’t too far apart. Phrase comes in at 43% of impressions and 41% of conversions, with broad at 34% of impressions and 26% of conversions. It’s a common scenario where the best match type appears to be exact, followed by phrase and broad match when we examine conversion rates and the efficiency of each impression.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11944 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-pie-chart-1-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-pie-chart-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-pie-chart-1-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-pie-chart-1-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-pie-chart-1-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-pie-chart-1-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-pie-chart-1-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Phrase match has a higher conversion rate than broad match and by far the worst CPA. This shows again that Google struggles with setting bids for phrase match keywords.</p>
<p>Broad match generates a lot of cheap clicks, as it has the lowest conversion rate, but also the lowest CPA.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11943 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-bar-chart-1-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-bar-chart-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-bar-chart-1-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-bar-chart-1-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-bar-chart-1-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-bar-chart-1-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Conversions_-bar-chart-1-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Broad match is also the least used of all the match types, accounting for only 10% of keywords. This means there is more competition for exact match terms, which will drive up CPAs. However, the CPA for exact match is only $57, compared to $53 for broad match. The gap is fairly small.</p>
<h3>CPA vs. lead quality</h3>
<p>With lead generation campaigns, the CPA only tells part of the story. Lead quality is a massive factor in determining where to place your budget.</p>
<p>There’s no way for us to determine lead quality at scale; that’s for each advertiser to evaluate. Anecdotal evidence suggests that exact match keywords have a higher lead quality, but this may be changing. Many companies are bidding based on MQLs (marketing qualified leads) or lead quality rather than total leads.</p>
<h3>Match type recommendations for Max Conversion</h3>
<p>Start with exact match keywords as they have the highest conversion rates. They’ll set benchmarks for CPA, CTR, and conversion rates, which you can use to assess your search terms and match types.</p>
<p>If you can’t spend your entire budget on exact match, add your top keywords and search terms as broad match.</p>
<p>In highly niche or jargon-heavy industries where Google&#8217;s understanding may be limited, consider testing phrase match alongside broad match. It may yield better results in some cases. As always, examine lead quality in case you do see a difference in lead quality by match type.</p>
<h2 id="section10">Target CPA bidding</h2>
<p>With Target CPA, Google sets bids to try to meet your CPA goal.</p>
<p>While Max Conversion is primarily used by smaller lead gen companies, most mid-sized to enterprise lead gen companies use Target CPA.</p>
<p>Advertisers using Target CPA rely heavily on exact match as it makes up 43% of keywords. However, phrase and broad match are also significant, making up 29% and 28% of the keywords respectively. Once again, broad match generates a much larger percentage of impressions than the keyword count suggests. Over half of all impressions generated by Target CPA bidding come from broad match keywords.</p>
<p>While exact match is only 17% of impressions, it accounts for 29% of conversions. It’s still a force for lead generation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11946 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-pie-chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-pie-chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-pie-chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-pie-chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-pie-chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-pie-chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-pie-chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Looking at effectiveness, exact match is a clear winner. It has a much higher CTR, a higher conversion rate, and a significantly lower CPA than any other match type.</p>
<p>Phrase match edges out broad match for CTR, conversion rates, and CPA. This is one of the few bid methods (along with Target ROAS) where phrase match worked well with Google’s automated bid technology. It does appear that the more conversion data you have, the more effective phrase match becomes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11945 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-bar-chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-bar-chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-bar-chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-bar-chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-bar-chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-bar-chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA_-bar-chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>‘Target’ bid methods (both ROAS and CPA) are generally used by larger advertisers who have more conversion data to work with than most advertisers using ‘Max’ bid methods. Phrase and broad match keywords perform similarly. You can use a mixture or test them against each other to see what works best for you.</p>
<h3>Match type recommendations for Target CPA</h3>
<p>Start with exact match keywords. If you can’t spend your entire budget on exact match, add your top keywords and search terms as phrase match. If you have additional budget or want more volume, then add the broad match versions of your keywords.</p>
<h2 id="section18"><b>Target CPA with top products &amp; brand keywords</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Target CPA is another bid method where brand keywords and top products make a significant difference to the results. For most of this study, we removed brand-profile campaigns with very high CTRs, conversion rates, and ROAS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we wanted to ensure you see the whole picture. For these charts, we included brand campaigns, but still kept out anomalies (like conversion rates over 100%, $0.05 CPAs, etc). Here is the comparison of what non-brand vs. brand produces with Target CPA bidding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We see a higher reliance on exact match, which makes up 57% of the keywords. Exact match performs very well, as it produces 41% of the impressions but 61% of the conversions. Exact match is by far the most effective match type for this bid method.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12010 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-pie-chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-pie-chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-pie-chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-pie-chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-pie-chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-pie-chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-pie-chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the metrics are in line with what we expected. The highest CTR, conversion rate, and the lowest CPA are from exact match keywords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phrase match beats broad match. While broad match has respectable numbers, it’s far enough behind phrase that it should only be used to get more volume or if you can’t spend any more budget on phrase and exact match keywords. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the few bid methods where exact match did considerably better than broad match. Once again, we see that with enough data, Google can set appropriate bids for phrase match.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-12009 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-bar-chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-bar-chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-bar-chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-bar-chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-bar-chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-bar-chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-CPA-with-Brand-Terms-Included_-bar-chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Match type recommendations for Target CPA bidding for brand and top keywords</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with exact match keywords and spend as much as you can on this match type. If you have budget left over, add your keywords as phrase match. If you still have budget left or you just want to experiment, then layer in broad match keywords for your top search terms.</span></p>
<h1 id="section11">Other bid methods: Focusing on impressions &amp; clicks</h1>
<p>There are bid methods that don’t use conversions or revenue data in setting bids. We’ll still reference conversions when comparing the statistics for each method, to see how they perform by match type. This will help you make an informed decision on choosing your match types for these additional bid methods.</p>
<h2 id="section12">Manual CPC bidding</h2>
<p>With Manual CPC, you set the bids for every ad group or keyword. Before March 2025, you could use enhanced CPC, where Google gave some bid assistance. That option was retired, so now all bids are directly controlled by advertisers.</p>
<p>The most significant advantage of Manual CPC is that you have complete control over every bid modifier. This type of campaign usually has one or more bid modifiers in place.</p>
<p>Manual CPC bidding is generally employed for specific campaign types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely high CPC campaigns<br />
◦   Often CPCs are $100+, with $500+ not being uncommon</li>
<li>Campaigns that rely heavily on bid modifiers</li>
<li>Campaigns that use bid data Google doesn’t have access to<br />
◦   Example: Changing bids based on wait times in a call center</li>
<li>Campaigns with very little data, so automated bidding doesn’t have enough data to function</li>
<li>Brand campaigns. Brand is usually run with Manual CPC, Target IS, or Target CPA/ROAS bid methods</li>
<li>Campaigns that don’t pass conversion data to Google Ads<br />
◦   This commonly happens in healthcare or other privacy-regulated industries<br />
◦   Note: We excluded these campaigns from the study since there wasn’t any conversion data</li>
</ul>
<h3>Broad match used by smaller advertisers</h3>
<p>Exact match dominates this category, making up 70% of all keywords in Manual CPC campaigns. Exact match also has the highest percentage of clicks, conversions, and revenue.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11938 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Pie-Chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Pie-Chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Pie-Chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Pie-Chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Pie-Chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Pie-Chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Pie-Chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The data gets messy when we compare phrase to broad match. Broad match signals for bid purposes aren’t used in manual campaigns. However, the CPAs for broad match are half that of phrase match.</p>
<p>Interestingly, phrase match still maintains a higher ROAS than broad match, even with extremely high CPCs. This is a data anomaly. Manual CPC is one of the least used bid methods, and broad match only makes up 5% of overall keywords.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11937 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Bar-Chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Bar-Chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Bar-Chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Bar-Chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Bar-Chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Bar-Chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Manual-CPC_-Bar-Chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>When we segmented campaigns with budgets over $10,000 per month, broad match usage dropped to under 1% of keywords being used. Clearly, broad match is mainly being used by smaller advertisers.</p>
<p>Most small companies using Manual CPC bidding employ exact and broad match, and most high-CPC, large-budget campaigns use exact and phrase match. This is the cause of the significant difference in CPAs for phrase match.</p>
<p>Broad match has long been used to try to get more volume for small data campaigns, especially those who see ‘low search volume’ warnings in their account. Based on the data, it’s OK to use broad match in those campaigns.</p>
<h3>Match type recommendations for Manual CPC</h3>
<p>This bid method is used by two different types of advertisers:</p>
<p><strong>High CPC industries</strong><br />
In high CPC industries, it&#8217;s essential to only show your keywords on relevant search terms. Start with exact match, and if you have budget left, expand to phrase match. While you might experiment with broad match, do so sparingly and be sure to watch the search terms closely.</p>
<p><strong>Low-volume accounts</strong><br />
If you’re using manual CPC due to a lack of volume, then start with exact match and phrase match. You probably won’t be able to spend your budget on these match types, either due to ‘low volume alerts’ within Google Ads, or because there aren’t enough impressions available. In these cases, use broad match keywords to find more volume.</p>
<h2 id="section13">Max Clicks bidding</h2>
<p>Max Clicks focuses on capturing the most clicks, regardless of how those clicks perform.</p>
<p>This is a common bid method for small advertisers. It’s also used for launching new campaigns, allowing them to quickly accumulate data before switching to a conversion-based method.</p>
<h3>Low take-up of broad match</h3>
<p>Surprisingly, broad match only made up 10% of these keywords. However, it captured 22% of all clicks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11940 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Pie-chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Pie-chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Pie-chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Pie-chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Pie-chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Pie-chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Pie-chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Broad match also had the lowest CPA. There were only two bid methods where broad match had a lower CPA than exact match, and this is one of them.</p>
<p>Once again, the numbers for phrase and broad match are confusing. Phrase match has a higher CTR, but a lower conversion rate. While its conversion rate isn’t that far from broad match, its CPA is significantly higher. It still has a better ROAS than broad match.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11939 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Bar-chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Bar-chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Bar-chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Bar-chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Bar-chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Bar-chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Max-Clicks_-Bar-chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to know if the leads from any one match type are better or worse than another without lead quality data. It appears that broad match is capturing cheap clicks for users that will convert, which leads to a lower CPA than phrase match. However, those users have lower cart amounts, and why the phrase match ROAS is higher.</p>
<h3>Match type recommendations for Max Clicks</h3>
<p>If you just need clicks, broad match is a good option. To take click quality into account, you need to decide whether to focus on ROAS vs CPA:</p>
<p>If your goal is <strong>the most conversions and a low CPA</strong>, then start with exact and broad match keywords. If your campaigns consistently have more than 10 conversions per month, you should switch to Max Conversion bidding. For more than 30 conversions per month, switch to Target CPA bidding.</p>
<p>If your goal is <strong>a decent ROAS along with the most clicks possible</strong>, then start with exact and phrase match keywords. If you can’t spend your budgets, expand to broad match. If your campaigns consistently have more than 10 conversions per month, you should switch to Max Conversion Value bidding. For more than 30 conversions per month, switch to Target ROAS bidding.</p>
<p>Please note: some accounts find success with Target bidding around 15 conversions per month. You can always try out these bid methods to see how they work for you.</p>
<h2 id="section14">Target Impression Share bidding</h2>
<p>Target Impression Share aims to give your ads exposure based on where you want them to appear on a search results page. It’s most commonly used for brand or conquest (competitor brand or market domination for generic terms) campaigns.</p>
<p>The focus of this bid method is to provide specific keywords with exposure. As expected, exact match dominates usage at 59% of all keywords.</p>
<h3>Brand and competitor terms dominate</h3>
<p>Not only is exact match the most common match type used, but it also has by far the most impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue. Considering these are primarily brand keywords, this is expected. Broad match has a history of matching brand terms to random generic words, resulting in much lower CTR and conversion rates.</p>
<p>The conversion rates by match type were quite unusual, with phrase match having the highest conversion rate, but also the highest CPA.</p>
<p>Investigating this anomaly, we found that phrase was matching to many search terms, including: coupon, discount code, sale, or competitor terms.</p>
<p>The second item that stood out was the significantly lower conversion rates for this bid method compared to many others. This is directly related to how we cleaned the data to remove anomalies and brand data. Over 70% of campaigns using Impression Share bidding matched our brand profile of extremely high CTRs and conversion rates.</p>

<p>The data we’re left with is mostly small brands, competitor terms, or generic words. The generic term usage was led by the legal industry, where lawyers wanted to dominate the market for terms like ‘personal injury lawyer’.</p>
<p>When we include all campaigns using this bid method, the exact and phrase match CTRs and conversion rates increased by over 30%, while broad match lagged significantly behind.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11947 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-Impression-Share_-bar-chart-1024x1024.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-Impression-Share_-bar-chart-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-Impression-Share_-bar-chart-300x300.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-Impression-Share_-bar-chart-150x150.png 150w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-Impression-Share_-bar-chart-768x768.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-Impression-Share_-bar-chart-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Target-Impression-Share_-bar-chart-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3>Match type recommendations for Target Impression Share</h3>
<p>This bid method is used for two purposes:</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using Target Impression Share to maximize visibility for your <strong>brand and high-converting keywords</strong>, start with exact match. If you aren’t spending your budget, expand to phrase match. While broad has done OK with this bid method, expand sparingly. Broad match risks showing your ads for other brands or irrelevant keywords.</p>
<p>If you’re using Target Impression Share for <strong>conquest campaigns</strong> (competitor terms or non-brand terms where you want your ads to show all the time, regardless of CTRs or conversion rates), then you should also start with exact match. If you aren’t spending your budget, expand to phrase match.</p>
<p>Broad match rarely performs well for conquest campaigns since it will expand to search terms that aren’t related to your goal. You can test broad match keywords, but make sure you watch the search terms closely.</p>
<h2 id="section15">The phrase match problem: expansion without control</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that phrase match performs poorly for many bid methods. The match type has expanded to search terms we wouldn’t consider related to the actual keywords. The most common mismatches include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand terms matching to other brands</li>
<li>Brand terms matching to generic search terms</li>
<li>Generic keywords matching to unrelated search terms</li>
<li>Generic keywords matching to brands</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Luxury hotel Amsterdam</em> matching to <em>Rotterdam</em></li>
<li><em>Flights to Rome</em> matching to <em>cheap times to travel to Italy</em></li>
<li><em>Mortgage application</em> matching to: <em>can i buy a house with bad credit</em>, multiple brands</li>
<li><em>Large cap growth funds</em> matching to individual stock names, <em>Morningstar</em>, stock name dividends</li>
<li><em>Home plumbing repair</em> matching to individual room and plumbing items (sinks, faucets, tubs, etc), and questions like <em>what happens when i flush the toilet when the water is off</em></li>
</ul>
<p data-block-id="5e3313d6-e690-4ef8-bd2b-d261446a3952" data-pm-slice="1 1 []">In the past, these search terms would only have matched to these keywords with broad match.</p>
<p>To further complicate the issue, Google is ignoring many ad groups with closely related keywords. For instance, the home repair account has ad groups for sink repair, clogged toilets, shower installation, etc. However, the phrase match keyword <em>home plumbing repair</em>, which is in a different ad group, is showing ads instead of the more specific keywords.</p>
<p>Duplicate search terms occur when the same search terms show from multiple ad groups. When this happens, the wrong ads, bids, and landing pages are used for the duplicates. As these aren&#8217;t your chosen ads and landing pages for those terms, your CTRs and conversion rates suffer. This has remained a problem since the expansion of exact and phrase match several years ago. As Google keeps expanding phrase match, the problem is only getting worse.</p>
<h3>The phrase match bidding disconnect</h3>
<p>Phrase is matching to more and more search terms, becoming similar to broad match. However, phrase doesn’t use the bid signals that broad match can.<br />
Google has expanded the match type without compensating with better bid signals. This is obvious when, for many bid methods, phrase match has a higher conversion rate than broad, but a lower ROAS or higher CPA.</p>
<p>If Google were to set better bids for phrase match, it would be a more effective option than broad. Instead, broad match has better CPAs and ROAS, even with worse conversion rates.</p>
<p data-block-id="0cd72d7a-7142-4d92-aa36-0ec7d09fe2eb" data-pm-slice="1 1 []">For accounts with a lot of data and Target CPA/ROAS bidding, phrase match often improves on its own. For accounts with smaller amounts of data, it can become a liability.</p>
<p>It’s hard to say whether this is deliberate. Google may eventually eliminate match types, or its machine learning may simply struggle with search term expansion unless there&#8217;s a substantial amount of data.</p>

<h2 id="section17">What match type should you use?</h2>
<p>The right match type strategy depends on your advertiser profile and bid method.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a <strong>large advertiser with conversion tracking</strong>, then you probably use a &#8216;Target&#8217; bid method. In this case, the correct approach is still to start with exact match, expand to phrase, and finally broad match (based on your budget).</p>
<p>Phrase match may behave poorly when you first launch a campaign. As you accumulate data, you should see improvements.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a <strong>smaller advertiser with conversion tracking</strong>, you may rely on a ‘Max’ bid method. Starting with exact match and expanding to broad is most likely to work for you. Please still experiment with phrase match, as every account is different. However, broad match’s bid signals currently give it the edge for low-data accounts.</p>
<p>Working on campaigns that focus on target impression share or manually set CPCs? Prioritize exact and phrase match, and use broad match sparingly.</p>
<p>Always remember to watch your top search terms and add them as exact match keywords. This will help ensure the correct ad group shows ads, and PMax isn’t stealing impressions from your Search campaigns.</p>
<p>This data is what most advertisers will see, but there are always exceptions. Please review data from your own account to ensure every match type is working effectively based on your goals.</p>
<p>While Google may one day remove match types, they’re currently a powerful optimization lever. The correct match types will help increase your overall CTRs and conversion rates for your Google Ads accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve just increased your Google Ads budget by 20%, expecting a flood of new conversions. Instead, your spend shoots up while your results stay disappointingly flat.</p>
<p>Many companies assume that raising their budget will naturally lead to more conversions. In practice, this isn&#8217;t always the case.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll look at the most common reasons why increasing your budget doesn’t produce better results. Understanding these factors will help you avoid wasting money when scaling your Google Ads campaigns. Plus, we’ll share practical tips on what to check when your conversions stall.</p>
<h2>Lost impression share</h2>
<p>Impression share is the percentage of times your ads were displayed compared to how often they were eligible to be displayed. It’s one of the first things to check when evaluating whether a higher budget could bring in more conversions.</p>
<p>If your <em>Lost impression share due to budget</em> metric is 0%, then raising your budget is unlikely to have any impact. It means there are simply no new impressions to be had.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Impression-share-by-day.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11771 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Impression-share-by-day-1024x492.png" alt="Adalysis automatically calculates search impression share data for you" width="1024" height="492" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Impression-share-by-day-1024x492.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Impression-share-by-day-300x144.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Impression-share-by-day-768x369.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Impression-share-by-day-1536x738.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Impression-share-by-day.png 1538w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>That said, Lost impression share due to budget doesn’t guarantee more conversions. To predict the impact of a new budget, you’ll need to look closely at your impression share data and likely conversion changes at different budget levels.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Budget-Projections.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11772 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Budget-Projections-1024x472.png" alt="Performance boost projections from Adalysis help you to assess the impact of budget changes before you make them." width="1024" height="472" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Budget-Projections-1024x472.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Budget-Projections-300x138.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Budget-Projections-768x354.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Budget-Projections-1536x709.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Budget-Projections.png 1658w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>

<p>There can be several reasons why you might see <em>Lost impression share due to budget</em>, and still not get more conversions with more budget. Match type and bid method play a big role — let’s look at those next.</p>
<h2>Broad match &amp; bid methods</h2>
<p>Broad match allows your ads to show for a wide range of search terms. This includes variations of your keywords, words on your landing page, in the user’s search history, or other keywords in your ad group.</p>
<p>When you increase your budget while using broad match, you may start to show for new search terms. If these additional search terms aren&#8217;t relevant to your business, then you’ll often spend significantly more without any meaningful lift in conversions.</p>
<p>Your bid method plays a key role here:</p>
<ul>
<li>With tROAS or tCPA bidding, broad match will often get more conversions as you raise your budget.</li>
<li>With max clicks, tCPC, or CPC bidding, broad match doesn&#8217;t use conversion signals as it expands to new search terms. Additional budget may lead to more traffic, but not necessarily better performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, this account is using max conversion bidding, and broad match performs significantly worse than the other match types.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-max-bidding.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11774 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-max-bidding-1024x438.png" alt="Keyword match type analysis from Adalysis helps you to assess how different types of keyword are performing. " width="1024" height="438" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-max-bidding-1024x438.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-max-bidding-300x128.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-max-bidding-768x329.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-max-bidding-1536x658.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-max-bidding-2048x877.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Conversely, this account is using target ROAS bidding, and broad match is performing as well as phrase match.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-target-bidding.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11775" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-target-bidding-1024x469.png" alt="" width="1024" height="469" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-target-bidding-1024x469.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-target-bidding-300x137.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-target-bidding-768x352.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-target-bidding-1536x704.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Broad-match-target-bidding-2048x938.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>When scaling your budget, if you’re using broad match and don’t see an increase in conversions, make sure you’ve applied target CPA or target ROAS bidding.</p>
<h2>Bid methods with other match types</h2>
<p>Exact and phrase match also rely on specific bid methods. However, since exact and phrase match don’t expand to additional queries as aggressively as broad match does, they usually work well with any conversion-focused bid method.</p>
<p>If you raise your budgets and don’t see an increase in conversions, check if you’re using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target CPA</li>
<li>Target ROAS</li>
<li>Max conversions, or</li>
<li>Max revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming there’s a lost impression share due to budget, any of these bid methods should yield more conversions as your budget grows.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of how target vs. max bidding works, you could see higher CPAs or lower ROAS. To understand why this happens and learn more about <a href="https://adalysis.com/blog/learn-the-intricacies-of-target-vs-max-cpa-and-roas-bidding-video/">target vs. max bidding, please see this in-depth video</a>.</p>
<h2>Team or system bottlenecks</h2>
<p>Sometimes, raising your budget does bring more leads, but your team can&#8217;t handle the higher volume. In lead generation, this often means unanswered calls:</p>
<ul>
<li>No one answers the phone</li>
<li>The caller hangs up after a long wait</li>
<li>Too many leads for reps to call everyone back</li>
</ul>
<p>In e-commerce, the issue is often inventory. If you get more traffic for items that aren’t in stock, you rarely see more conversions.</p>
<p>Before increasing your budget, make sure you’re ready to handle a higher volume of leads or product sales. Otherwise, that extra money won’t deliver better results.</p>
<h2>Quality scores</h2>
<p>Low quality scores can prevent your ads from showing more often. This can happen because your ad rank is too low to qualify for the auction, or because Google doesn’t see your offer as relevant to the searcher.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Account-QS.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11776 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Account-QS-1024x303.png" alt="Quality score analysis from Adalysis automates insights to help you improve your budget optimization." width="1024" height="303" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Account-QS-1024x303.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Account-QS-300x89.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Account-QS-768x227.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Account-QS.png 1079w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>If you raise your budget but don’t see more conversions (or even clicks or impressions), take a look at your quality scores.</p>
<p>For example, one company was struggling to spend more, so they reworked their ads with more pinning and testing. As a result, their expected CTR increased nicely, and their ads started showing much more often.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trended-QS.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11777 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trended-QS-1024x698.png" alt="This quality score history from Adalysis shows the improvements one customer was able to achieve." width="1024" height="698" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trended-QS-1024x698.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trended-QS-300x205.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trended-QS-768x524.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trended-QS.png 1081w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>

<h2>Campaign cannibalization</h2>
<p>Another scenario arises when a company increases its budgets for several campaigns at once. One campaign may receive significantly more impressions than the others. If your worst-performing campaign gets most of the new impressions, your better ones can suffer.</p>
<p>This is most common when you raise budgets for both Performance Max and Search at the same time.</p>
<p>If this is happening in your account, start by reading how <a href="https://adalysis.com/blog/is-performance-max-cannibalizing-your-search-ads-a-deep-dive-into-search-term-overlap/">PMax cannibalizes search campaigns</a> to understand the mechanics. Then look at the common reasons <a href="https://adalysis.com/blog/seven-reasons-pmax-is-stealing-your-search-impressions/">why PMax is stealing search impressions</a> so you can find and fix the issues.</p>
<h2>Baseline performance</h2>
<p>Many business owners see low conversion numbers and follow Google’s recommendations, which often revolve around budget. The company increases its ad spend, but the conversions still don’t arrive.</p>
<p>If your account isn’t converting well from the start, adding more budget usually won’t change that. The first step is to audit your account and ensure you have a solid foundation before scaling the budget.</p>

<p>You want to ensure you’re getting the most out of your PPC spend, but we&#8217;ve seen that raising budgets can backfire if you haven&#8217;t got the right foundation. Run through this checklist before investing more money:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check your lost impression share due to budget</strong><br />
If it&#8217;s 0%, more budget won&#8217;t help</li>
<li><strong>Review your match types and bid methods</strong><br />
Make sure you’ve got the right bid method, especially with broad match</li>
<li><strong>Audit your operational capacity</strong><br />
Can you actually handle more leads or orders?</li>
<li><strong>Boost your quality scores</strong><br />
Low scores limit your visibility regardless of budget</li>
<li><strong>Look for campaign cannibalization</strong><br />
One campaign might be stealing impressions from better performers</li>
<li><strong>Assess your baseline performance</strong><br />
You can&#8217;t scale what doesn&#8217;t already work</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scaling an audit process as your agency grows remains stubbornly difficult. Analysts bring different habits with them when they join the team. A checklist alone doesn’t guarantee a repeatable, efficient process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While scripts help automate parts of the audit, they can also bring new headaches. Installing, maintaining, and troubleshooting scripts can become a job in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI promises to reshape PPC workflows. Teams are experimenting with everything from ad generation to performance analysis, but integration challenges persist. Most AI tools, including ChatGPT, can’t access live Google Ads data. Many PPC teams also remain skeptical of AI guidance — including Google&#8217;s own recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we’ll break down smart ways you can approach PPC audit automation to help your team save time. And we&#8217;ll highlight how to balance automation with human oversight.</span></p>
<h2><b>Step 1: Start with the basics</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with audit checks that are consistent, repeatable, and don’t need human judgment. Like spotting broken links or disapproved ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automate quick wins to start saving time fast. They&#8217;re also checks that can easily get missed when things are busy or if the team is juggling lots of accounts. If your client notices them first, it can look like you&#8217;re not paying enough attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of automation is straightforward at the account level. However, logging into every account individually takes time. Ideally, you&#8217;ll want to build an alert system and a way of filtering your accounts by alert type.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where Adalysis can help. We offer 100+ prebuilt audit alerts covering the most common issues, including campaign settings, search terms, keywords, negatives, landing pages, ads, PMax, and more. You can choose email or Slack alerts, or filter them directly from your accounts overview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By automating these routine checks, your team can focus on higher-value tasks.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11748" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/audit-breakdown-1024x624.png" alt="Adalysis audit dashboard" width="600" height="366" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/audit-breakdown-1024x624.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/audit-breakdown-300x183.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/audit-breakdown-768x468.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/audit-breakdown.png 1109w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h2><b>Step 2: Fine-tune for your accounts</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve automated the basics, the next step is adapting your audit process to reflect your account strategy and data volume. Different strategies, volumes, and goals call for different thresholds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if you manage an account with low traffic, you may want to receive keyword bid recommendations after 25, rather than 50 clicks. You may also want data from the last 90 days rather than the last 30 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have an account with a strict CPA target, you might want alerts if a keyword or search term rises above your target. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without customization, automated audits can flood your team with false alerts. Or they can miss issues that matter for specific accounts. This is why your team&#8217;s expertise is crucial for reliable and smart audit automation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some audit platforms offer customizable thresholds. Adalysis goes further with bulk changes and global settings templates. You can apply consistent settings to multiple accounts without configuring each one individually. This makes customization scalable rather than a time-consuming manual process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result: alerts that help your team prioritize, not just sift through more noise.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11749" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/audit-threshol.png" alt="Adalysis alert settings for keywords with poor conversions check" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/audit-threshol.png 713w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/audit-threshol-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some alert thresholds Adalysis users regularly customize:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Duplicate search terms</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: minimum impressions (default: 50)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Underperforming keywords, segments, or search partner network traffic</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: minimum conversions and/or CPA</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>New keyword suggestions from search terms</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: minimum conversions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>New negative keyword suggestions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: minimum conversions and clicks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Placement exclusions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: maximum CPA (i.e. CPA over $xx)</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Step 3: Review what’s still manual</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everything should be automated. Some checks require context or judgment — they’re better handled by humans. Take conversion tracking, for example. It’s simply too dependent on your business goals and website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why it’s worth reviewing your audit process regularly with your team. Which checks are still manual? Is there a good reason for this or could they be automated with the right logic?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your team relies on checks that aren’t covered by prebuilt alerts in Adalysis, you can create custom ones. Here are some common examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Campaign CPA or ROAS</strong> trending in the wrong direction</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Budget</strong> increasing when performance threshold crossed</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Keywords</strong> not meeting minimum performance thresholds</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is being intentional about what you automate versus what requires human expertise. Your team&#8217;s strategic thinking should focus on analysis and decision-making, not wrangling spreadsheets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation doesn’t have to stop at alerts either. Many alerts in Adalysis can also trigger automatic actions. For example, an alert about underperforming ads can pause those ads immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation is most valuable when it extends beyond detection to action. If you’re only using it to flag issues, you might be missing out on the next level of efficiency.</span></p>
<h2><b>Wrap-up</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most effective PPC audit automation happens in stages: start with obvious technical issues, customize for account-specific needs, keep human judgment where it matters most, and gradually extend into automated actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your team&#8217;s expertise remains the cornerstone of this process. Automation should amplify your strategic thinking, not replace it. The goal isn&#8217;t to eliminate human involvement. It&#8217;s to focus that involvement on analysis and decision-making rather than routine detection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Done right, this approach saves time while improving consistency across accounts. More importantly, it scales with your agency without sacrificing the quality your clients depend on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://adalysis.com/ppc-budget-management/">Budget management</a> has been a key focus at Adalysis over recent years. We&#8217;ve spent a lot of time listening to your challenges with running PPC at scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we&#8217;ll explore the biggest talking points and what we’re doing to lighten the load.</span></p>
<h2><b>Challenge 1: Real-time PPC budget tracking</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping track of hundreds of budgets in real-time takes lots of time, and it’s easy to make mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without automation, agencies often rely on spreadsheets and manual checks in Google Ads. Gathering the data at scale is a time drain all on its own, especially when clients have different budget structures. This manual process also introduces a real risk of human error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single oversight can mean overspending (or underspending) on a client’s account. And from their perspective, it doesn’t matter how many other budgets you manage. They just want to know their account is on track.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Adalysis can help</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adalysis tracks budget pacing on an hourly basis and projects future spend based on your chosen settings. You can see budget pacing for all your Google Ads and Microsoft Ads accounts from a single overview screen. That means no more data crunching and jumping between tabs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alerts for spend and pacing mean you’ll always get a heads-up when costs hit a critical threshold. You can set budgets to pause and restart budgets automatically, to strictly avoid overspending. It&#8217;s also possible to rollover unspent funds and deficits to the next budget cycle.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11599 size-full" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Budget-overview-table.png" alt="Monthly spend, budget boost alerts and target budget pacing from the Adalysis dashboard for all PPC accounts in one place." width="323" height="247" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Budget-overview-table.png 323w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Budget-overview-table-300x229.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" /></p>
<h2><b>Challenge 2: Overspends, underspends, and flatlines</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We probably all know that moment of panic: you open an account and realize the budget wasn&#8217;t adjusted in time. Maybe it spent more than it should have. Maybe it underspent and missed valuable traffic. Or worse, the campaign stopped serving ads without anyone noticing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This usually comes down to a breakdown in communication or oversight. Budget changes weren’t passed along to the client, or a pacing issue slipped through the cracks. And the fallout can be uncomfortable. Clients don’t want excuses; they want assurance that their campaigns are active, efficient, and on budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At scale, these risks multiply. Without reliable monitoring and alerts, even the most diligent teams can fail to spot a critical change.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Adalysis can help</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get critical alerts if your ads have stopped running. Adalysis monitors your campaigns around the clock, so you&#8217;ll know about issues before anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adalysis simplifies budget management by automatically adjusting daily budgets. The system factors in your ad schedule and other settings to ensure you stay on track. That means no more manual monitoring, and no more nasty surprises from over- or underspending.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11600 size-full" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/campaigns-in-a-budget.png" alt="Budget overview for all campaigns and shared budgets from Adalysis" width="1749" height="428" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/campaigns-in-a-budget.png 1749w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/campaigns-in-a-budget-300x73.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/campaigns-in-a-budget-1024x251.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/campaigns-in-a-budget-768x188.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/campaigns-in-a-budget-1536x376.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1749px) 100vw, 1749px" /></p>
<h2><b>Challenge 3: Insights buried in data overload</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing high volumes of data can be overwhelming. Pacing, spend, remaining budgets, and projections often live in separate reports or spreadsheets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extracting actionable insights quickly is difficult, and the more you scale, the harder it gets. The problem isn’t a lack of data; it’s knowing where to look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another challenge for PPC advertisers is the lack of flexibility in Google Ads. There’s no simple way to manage monthly budgets or allocate spend across campaigns effectively. Shared budgets have limitations, and allocating budgets across campaigns is tricky.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Adalysis can help</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get reliable forecasts based on account history, seasonality, ad schedule, and recent changes. Download data or share insights with colleagues and clients straight from the dashboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Split your budget across a whole account or a group of campaigns. Budget groups give you more flexibility and control than the standard options in Google Ads. In particular, Adalysis lets you define performance goals, get control over pacing, and see spend projections for each group.</span></p>

<h2><b>Challenge 4: Getting campaign allocation right</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figuring out how to distribute a client’s budget is a constant balancing act. High-performing campaigns need room to grow. Underperformers can drain ad spend if not kept in check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotting when to reallocate budgets is another time-sensitive task for PPC teams. The longer it takes to collect and analyze the data, the easier it is to miss the window to optimize.</span></p>
<h3><b>How Adalysis can help</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adalysis alerts you to opportunities to scale your budget based on impression share loss. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll get a heads-up if a campaign’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lost impression share (budget)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exceeds 10% for three consecutive days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined with detailed performance dashboards, these alerts make it easy to identify where to reallocate your budget and keep campaigns running efficiently.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11601 size-full" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/performance-boost-chart.png" alt="Performance boost projections from Adalysis show you the potential impact of budget changes before you make them." width="916" height="630" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/performance-boost-chart.png 916w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/performance-boost-chart-300x206.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/performance-boost-chart-768x528.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px" /></p>
<h2><b>Wrap-up</b></h2>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11695" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Brad-Geddes-at-Google-Marketing-Live-1024x771.jpg" alt="Brad Geddes at Google Marketing Live 2025" width="600" height="452" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Brad-Geddes-at-Google-Marketing-Live-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Brad-Geddes-at-Google-Marketing-Live-300x226.jpg 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Brad-Geddes-at-Google-Marketing-Live-768x578.jpg 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Brad-Geddes-at-Google-Marketing-Live-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Brad-Geddes-at-Google-Marketing-Live-2048x1542.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We won&#8217;t dive into every new feature, as they’re already covered on sites like Search Engine Land. Instead, we’ll focus on the bigger picture and what it signals for the year ahead.</span></p>
<h2><b>Shopping, shopping, and more shopping</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard ‘lead gen’ mentioned once. There was a single nod to local business marketing, which was almost an afterthought. Most of the new features heavily focused on shopping, especially fashion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is introducing new features to enhance the shopping experience. Many reminded me of Smart Mirror and Microsoft HoloLens marketing decks, mixed with AI image and video creation. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bulk image creation for your products in different seasons and models</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bulk image editing in a new centralized media center within Google Ads</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to see yourself in different outfits</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistants watching price drops</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new ‘Try it on’ feature is likely to be very popular. It allows you to upload an image and see yourself in different outfits to determine how you like the look.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11696 size-medium" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Try-it-On-140x300.png" alt="" width="140" height="300" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Try-it-On-140x300.png 140w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Try-it-On.png 420w" sizes="(max-width: 140px) 100vw, 140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube also featured heavily in the Shopping theme. Google started targeting TV advertisers to move ad spend to YouTube several years ago. Recent stats suggest they’ve succeeded.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11697" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/YouTube-shopping-hours-1024x477.png" alt="" width="600" height="279" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/YouTube-shopping-hours-1024x477.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/YouTube-shopping-hours-300x140.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/YouTube-shopping-hours-768x357.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/YouTube-shopping-hours.png 1345w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these changes are possible due to AI and influencer marketing, which leads us to our second biggest theme.</span></p>
<h2><b>AI</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can count pretty high. I can count very fast. I’m not sure anyone could have kept up with the sheer mentions of AI over a single day. However, most AI mentions were related to shopping, especially fashion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google did mention the new AI Max for Search feature, but spent little time on it. We also got a marketing change from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power Pair</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (search campaigns combined with PMax) to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power Pack</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11699" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Power-Pack-1024x428.png" alt="Google's Power Pack, Google Marketing Live 2025" width="600" height="251" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Power-Pack-1024x428.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Power-Pack-300x125.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Power-Pack-768x321.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Power-Pack-1536x642.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Power-Pack.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Power Pair marketing from last year fell flat, and many advertisers aren’t happy with how </span><a href="https://adalysis.com/blog/is-performance-max-cannibalizing-your-search-ads-a-deep-dive-into-search-term-overlap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PMax steals search impressions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I have a feeling the same will be said for the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power Pack </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">next year. However, be prepared to hear from your reps how you need to use these three campaigns together.</span></p>
<h3><b>AI for image &amp; video creation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Veo is an AI video generator with fantastic results, if you have the time and resources needed. Google shared a story of a large company that went from planning and storyboarding to a full commercial in about four weeks. While this is fast, most Google advertisers don’t have the resources (or need) to create videos with these methods yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The output is so impressive that I think by this time next year, we’ll likely see AI video creation tools promising easy personalization. Even average advertisers will be able to produce YouTube content and video ads this way. We’ll be watching closely, as it could be an excellent shift for many brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my view, ChatGPT, Midjourney, and others are far ahead of Google Gemini in terms of image creation. They can understand prompt refinement and follow instructions more closely than Gemini. That said, Gemini is significantly faster than many of its competitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Google can improve its image refinement for product images, models, and backgrounds, we should see a rise in AI image creation and manipulation within Google Ads in the coming months. That would be a real boon to e-commerce companies.</span></p>
<h3>Agentic support and advice</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agentic support and advice are arguably the most useful AI announcements for advertisers. They&#8217;re essentially AI chats tied directly to your Google Ads data and account. Here’s an example shared at Google Marketing Live:</span></p>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11700 size-medium" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/agentic-ai-228x300.png" alt="Google's agentic support, Google Marketing Live 2025" width="228" height="300" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/agentic-ai-228x300.png 228w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/agentic-ai-778x1024.png 778w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/agentic-ai-768x1011.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/agentic-ai.png 964w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" /></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These agents also pull in Google recommendations, set up experiments, and handle other routine tasks. Their effectiveness remains to be seen. However, from a reporting standpoint, they could save you a lot of time by eliminating spreadsheet comparisons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have high hopes that they&#8217;re not just glorified Google recommendations. They could become powerful tools, providing information for new Google Ads components and reports. Overall, I think this will be the most useful new feature for all advertisers.</span></p>
<h2><b>Influencers</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, Google hypes YouTube. This year, the focus was on creator and influencer marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube is often considered the second-largest search engine, after</span><a href="http://google.com"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Google shared stats showing that 45% of their audience isn&#8217;t on TikTok, and 65% don&#8217;t use Reels. They discussed that YouTube creators are more trusted than influencers on other platforms.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11701" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/YouTube-vs-TikTok-300x189.png" alt="" width="600" height="379" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/YouTube-vs-TikTok-300x189.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/YouTube-vs-TikTok-768x485.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/YouTube-vs-TikTok.png 859w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To capitalize on this, Google is launching a system to pair up marketers and creators so you can create influencer campaigns on YouTube. This might be useful for smaller brands that don’t have much time to manage influencer partnerships.</span></p>
<p data-block-id="89589314-d880-4be3-a6bf-0cc02b3a2211" data-pm-slice="1 1 []">We can interpret this as Google trying to keep up with Meta and TikTok, as Google is often behind in social tools. However, Google has rarely played the parity game for the sake of offering what other platforms are doing. There’s often a business reason for changes.</p>
<p data-block-id="30229b98-424b-46f4-b332-5326b0b7dd61">From a business perspective, YouTube is trying to entice creators and businesses away from its social competitors. It also wants to grow its share of video advertising dollars, which comes not only from its social media but also from streaming and traditional TV commercials. Expect to see new disclaimer labels and ad formats to support this system.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interesting moment came in the last session as Katie Couric interviewed Emma Grede (fashion designer and Shark Tank guest). When asked about influencer marketing, Emma said she thought it was useful for launching new brands and products. She believes that after the launch, influencers shouldn&#8217;t be necessary for ongoing sales.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11702" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Katie-Couric-interviewed-Emma-Grede-1024x431.png" alt="" width="600" height="252" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Katie-Couric-interviewed-Emma-Grede-1024x431.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Katie-Couric-interviewed-Emma-Grede-300x126.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Katie-Couric-interviewed-Emma-Grede-768x323.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Katie-Couric-interviewed-Emma-Grede-1536x646.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Katie-Couric-interviewed-Emma-Grede.png 1552w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reports on how influencers raise sales, but only mixed stats on how prolonged the rise is or how long-term the customers become.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that fashion and beauty brands use influencer marketing the most, it&#8217;s no surprise that Google is paying attention to this space. With Google’s focus on YouTube and shopping, it&#8217;s logical that they’d want to foster relationships between brands and creators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve thought about influencer marketing, but haven&#8217;t had the time or resources, you’ll want to keep an eye on this new marketplace when it launches. </span></p>
<h2><b>Focus on Gen Z</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google focused on Gen Z at this year&#8217;s event. According to the presentation, Gen Z searches more than any other group, trusts influencers more than their friends and family, and is the long-term future of many businesses.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11703" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/18-24-searchers-1024x538.png" alt="" width="600" height="315" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/18-24-searchers-1024x538.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/18-24-searchers-300x158.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/18-24-searchers-768x404.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/18-24-searchers.png 1475w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials and all other age groups trust businesses and friends more than influencers. So it’s no surprise Google is catering to Gen Z.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I wonder if this will ultimately be to Google&#8217;s detriment in the long term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Assistant, Gemini, and Lens only have dark themes, even if light mode is your phone&#8217;s default. Almost every instance of AI on a phone during Google&#8217;s presentations used a dark mode screenshot. These design elements lock many users out of using Android’s most advanced features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s well known that iPhone users earn more and spend more on apps than Android users. While Android leads globally in market share, in the US, Gen Z prefers iPhones. Apple also has a reputation for stronger security, which may be a contributing factor.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11704 size-full" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iphone-vs-android-age-stats.png" alt="" width="880" height="313" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iphone-vs-android-age-stats.png 880w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iphone-vs-android-age-stats-300x107.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iphone-vs-android-age-stats-768x273.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source: </span><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/iphone-android-users"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://explodingtopics.com/blog/iphone-android-users</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Android continues prioritizing Gen Z through its design choices and overlooks other age groups, we may see a shift in marketing tactics towards older demographics. While Google search and YouTube video hours remain unparalleled, things can always change. This is a trend I’ll be watching, as I can see Google losing market share for demographics other than Gen Z and younger millennials.</span></p>
<h2><b>Attribution and incrementality </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to measurement, Google emphasized incrementality over total returns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since most companies already allocate budget to Google Ads, Google doesn’t need to focus on winning your business. Instead, it aims to increase its share of your overall advertising spend. If you had an extra $10,000 this month, which platform would you use?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why measurement took center stage. One stat surprised me: only 44% of &#8216;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">senior marketing analytics professionals&#8217;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use a combination of marketing mix models (MMM), attribution solutions, and incrementality testing. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-11706" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MMM-attribution-1024x537.png" alt="" width="600" height="315" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MMM-attribution-1024x537.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MMM-attribution-300x157.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MMM-attribution-768x403.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MMM-attribution.png 1209w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankly, I was surprised it was this high. It suggests cherry-picking, as the professionals&#8217; title was part of the caveat. When you look across all of Google’s millions of advertisers, most are too small to employ someone in that role, so they&#8217;re excluded from the analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has tried to make attribution data more accessible to everyone with</span><a href="https://developers.google.com/meridian"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Meridian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, their open-source MMM and incrementality testing tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most celebrated announcements during the entire presentation: Google is lowering the budget needed for incrementality testing to $5k. I believe the previous number was around $50k. This could be a game-changer and enable many more advertisers to finally start incrementality testing. However, there are still unanswered questions around accuracy at this spend level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In parallel, Google Ads Data Manager is receiving updates to simplify how advertisers can ensure accurate data and gain valuable insights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the non-ecommerce companies, the data section was by far the most welcome announcement. Measurement remains essential to running profitable Google Ads campaigns, and Google is upping its support in this area. </span></p>
<h2><b>Wrap-up</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Google focused heavily on PMax, AI overviews, recommendations, Demand Gen, Optimization Score, YouTube, and shopping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the themes remain, and Google has once again largely overlooked B2B, lead generation, and local marketing (outside of Demand Gen campaigns). If you&#8217;re involved with shopping, it was yet another fantastic Google Marketing Live with a preview of all the new features coming your way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, last year, there was a heavy focus on Google telling you what to do, which came via PMax, the Power Pair, recommendations, and Optimization Score via AI Essentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year felt different. Rather than trying to sell AI, Google showed what it can do and how you could use it. It was a welcome shift that was more respectful towards their attendees as there were many brilliant marketers in attendance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we’re looking forward to many of the features coming to Google Ads, I think three will be the most impactful for all advertisers.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Agentic support and advice</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could save hours of work through reporting, insights, and experiment launches. I have high hopes here. I think we’ll see growing pains, and it will take time to trust the output. However, this feature could function as a built-in assistant for your more tedious tasks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Incrementality testing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: If Google can provide accurate insights for only $5k, sophisticated testing will be available to far more companies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>AI-created video</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Google Veo could be the future of video creation for many advertisers. Let’s just hope we don’t get a lot of low-quality AI videos cluttering up our feeds.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll be testing and bringing the most relevant new features into Adalysis, so you can focus on actionable data and streamlining your daily workflow with the latest tools from Google.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;How much time can my team save with Adalysis?&#8217; It’s a question we’re hearing more and more often. Like most good PPC answers, the honest one is: it depends. Your workflow, team setup, and account complexity all play a role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, we know Adalysis consistently saves PPC teams hours of repetitive (and often boring) work. And we’ve got the case studies to prove it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Adalysis customers, that often means more time for value-add tasks they would otherwise have to deprioritize. It’s one way we help you get better results from your campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we’ll highlight five PPC tools that deliver big time savings. Hopefully, it’ll help you get a clearer picture of what Adalysis could do for your team.</span></p>
<h2><b>Discovering, debugging, and fixing account issues</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most marketers don’t need more charts — they need answers. This is why Adalysis offers an end-to-end workflow: from data gathering to root cause analysis and communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adalysis monitors your KPIs automatically, so that you can save time on spreadsheets and pivot tables. You’ll get clear, actionable insights for your daily, weekly, or monthly reviews. Performance alerts flag trends as soon as they arise, so you can act more quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://docs.adalysis.com/tools/performance/root-cause-analysis-the-performance-analyzer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance Analyzer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> visualizes how different metrics influence each other. This means you can easily see the root cause of a performance trend. You can then download the analysis to share with your stakeholders. Many Adalysis customers also present insights straight from the platform.</span></p>
<p><b>Time saving:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 30-60 minutes per week, per account</span></p>

<h2><b>Keeping budgets on track</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget overspend. Two words to drive ice-cold chills down the spine of any PPC manager. Whether you&#8217;re handling a handful of accounts or hundreds, keeping spend on track takes serious time and attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adalysis helps in two ways: pacing and budget automation. For pacing, you’ll get budget data updated hourly and spending forecasts. You can also:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Configure alerts for spend (absolute numbers) or pacing (relative to the day of the month)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatically pause and resume campaigns based on your spend and cycle</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roll over unused budgets or overspend</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget boost alerts with performance projections for when there&#8217;s potential to scale</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adalysis can also manage your daily budgets based on your performance goals. While Google Ads only offers daily budgets, Adalysis offers clever ways to manage monthly targets for groups of campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re confident that Adalysis has one of the most comprehensive budget solutions available. It’s designed to save you time and keep you in control.</span></p>
<p><b>Time savings</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: 1-2 days per month, per budget.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is one of the best features of Adalysis. Once you input the budget, you can sit back and relax, as it automatically manages the task without any manual intervention. Additionally, there are numerous sub-options available to cover every scenario you might need.” Prasanna Mody, Managing Director, <a href="https://adalysis.com/case-study/ebrandz/">eBrandz</a></span></p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Edit once, update ads in bulk</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updating RSA assets in Google Ads can be painfully slow, as you’re limited to editing one ad at a time. When you’re managing dozens or hundreds of ad groups, that adds up fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adalysis removes that bottleneck. You can add, edit, and delete assets, adjust pinning, and roll out creative updates across multiple campaigns in a few clicks. Whether it’s a quick headline refresh or a full-scale copy overhaul, you’ll save serious time compared to the Google Ads UI.</span></p>
<p><b>Time saving:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from thirty minutes for a simple refresh to several days for a creative overhaul.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11552 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rsa-manager_blog-1024x210.png" alt="Responsive search ad headlines and descriptions in the Adalysis RSA Manager" width="1024" height="210" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rsa-manager_blog-1024x210.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rsa-manager_blog-300x62.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rsa-manager_blog-768x158.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rsa-manager_blog.png 1043w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2><b>PPC audits on your terms: customize, automate, scale</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one is a favorite with our agency customers, juggling lots of PPC accounts and sales audits. It’s a process that’s tough to scale manually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adalysis automates 100+ prebuilt audit checks. That includes broken links, disapprovals, keyword conflicts, underperforming ads, and a lot more. You can customize alert thresholds and create your own custom alerts. The result is a custom audit checklist that runs automatically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No more spreadsheets. No scripts. Just fast, scalable auditing.</span></p>
<p><b>Time saving:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 3-5 hours per audit</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Absolutely love the audit and alerts system in Adalysis. One of our favorite features. It makes it so much easier to see and prioritize problem areas in an account. It&#8217;s great for making the fixes quick and painless too. I like that for pretty much every alert, you&#8217;re just a few clicks away from fixing the issue. This is thanks to the custom links that will take you to a custom area built specifically to help you save time fixing whatever that issue was.” Daryl Mander, Founder, </span><a href="https://adalysis.com/case-study/bigflare/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Flare</span></a></p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Automated ad testing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no need to set up A/B tests or work out statistical significance manually. Adalysis automatically runs tests in every ad group with at least two variations. You&#8217;ll get an alert as soon as there’s a winner. This means you can iterate faster without the time sink of manual test management. You can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create new ad copy with generative AI</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pause losing ads automatically</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test across six metrics to identify underperforming ads</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Time saving:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from 15-60 minutes per ad test</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11553 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ad-testing_blog-1024x366.png" alt="Screenshot of ad testing results from Adalysis" width="1024" height="366" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ad-testing_blog-1024x366.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ad-testing_blog-300x107.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ad-testing_blog-768x275.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ad-testing_blog.png 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adalysis users also save time by having everything in one place. Switching between reports, spreadsheets, and ad platforms may only take seconds. However, the time quickly adds up across your team and workflow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 40+ integrated PPC tools, Adalysis gives you instant access to everything from quality score to search terms and bidding.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managing search terms is one of the most time-consuming tasks in Google Ads. Since search terms are the actual queries users type into a search engine, they must be reflected in ads and landing pages to avoid wasted ad spend.</p>
<p>Not all search terms are relevant to your business. It&#8217;s crucial to review them to decide whether to add them as keywords or negatives. For PMax campaigns, you’ll also need to <a href="https://adalysis.com/blog/is-performance-max-cannibalizing-your-search-ads-a-deep-dive-into-search-term-overlap/">determine the appropriate</a> campaign for the search term.</p>
<p>With thousands or even millions of search terms in many accounts, manually assessing them isn&#8217;t feasible. This is where n-grams can help.</p>
<h2>What are n-grams?</h2>
<p>N-grams are one, two, or three-word patterns found in your search terms. You can aggregate performance data for each n-gram to evaluate its impact on your account.</p>
<p>For instance, if you have a list of search terms like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>San Diego Plumber services</li>
<li>Plumbing services</li>
<li>Plumbing services in San Diego</li>
<li>Plumber phone number</li>
<li>Emergency plumber</li>
<li>Emergency plumbing services</li>
</ul>
<p>You can break them into n-grams and evaluate the data:</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/n-gram-chart.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11298" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/n-gram-chart.png" alt="" width="270" height="235" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/n-gram-chart.png 538w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/n-gram-chart-300x262.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /></a></p>
<p>This is a sample of the above n-grams. In a full analysis, there would be more n-grams such as: San, Diego, in, number, phone, etc.</p>
<p>Instead of analyzing each search term individually, you&#8217;re looking at patterns that appear across many terms. An account with a million search terms often only has 30,000–50,000 n-grams. While still a large number, filtering and sorting this data makes it far easier to find insights.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the most common ways to use n-grams.</p>
<h2>Preventing wasted spend</h2>
<p>By far, the biggest use of n-grams is finding wasted spend and potential negative keywords.</p>
<p>There are two common filters you can apply to your n-grams to find potential negatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clicks &gt; 150 and conversions = 0</li>
<li>Conversions = 0, and sort by cost (as shown in the Adalysis screenshot below)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/n-gram-data-with-0-conversions.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11285" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/n-gram-data-with-0-conversions.png" alt="" width="2063" height="782" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/n-gram-data-with-0-conversions.png 2063w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/n-gram-data-with-0-conversions-300x114.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/n-gram-data-with-0-conversions-1024x388.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/n-gram-data-with-0-conversions-768x291.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/n-gram-data-with-0-conversions-1536x582.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/n-gram-data-with-0-conversions-2048x776.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2063px) 100vw, 2063px" /></a></p>
<p>When reviewing this data, two n-gram-specific columns can help guide your analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Word count: Is the n-gram a one, two, or three-word phrase</li>
<li>Instance count: How many times did the phrase appear in your search terms</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, the phrases ‘<em>and leisure</em>’ and ‘<em>lawn and leisure</em>’ appeared in <strong>265</strong> search terms. With <strong>99 clicks</strong> each, the average click per search term is less than one. Finding this type of pattern manually across thousands of search terms is almost impossible.</p>
<p>With n-grams, it becomes clear that search terms including ‘and leisure’ or ‘lawn and leisure’ have spent over <strong>$1,000</strong>, with <strong>zero conversions</strong>.</p>
<p>At this point, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the n-gram as a negative keyword</li>
<li>Review the search term data for that n-gram to investigate further</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking closer, many search terms relate to an event called ‘Lawn and Leisure’ in Missouri. We’re not associated with this summit, and yet, we’ve spent over $1000 on search terms related to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lawn-and-leisure-search-terms.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11286" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lawn-and-leisure-search-terms.png" alt="" width="2219" height="478" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lawn-and-leisure-search-terms.png 2219w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lawn-and-leisure-search-terms-300x65.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lawn-and-leisure-search-terms-1024x221.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lawn-and-leisure-search-terms-768x165.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lawn-and-leisure-search-terms-1536x331.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lawn-and-leisure-search-terms-2048x441.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2219px) 100vw, 2219px" /></a></p>
<p>This is an easy negative keyword to add since it’s unlikely to bring any additional value to our company.</p>
<h2>Finding high CPA or low ROAS terms</h2>
<p>In our previous filters, we looked at n-grams with zero conversions. You’ll often have search terms that are converting, but at very high CPAs.</p>
<p>Sorting your n-gram data by cost per conversion (CPA) or conv. value/cost (ROAS) will show you which terms perform the worst.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Expensive-CPA.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11288" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Expensive-CPA.png" alt="" width="2062" height="584" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Expensive-CPA.png 2062w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Expensive-CPA-300x85.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Expensive-CPA-1024x290.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Expensive-CPA-768x218.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Expensive-CPA-1536x435.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Expensive-CPA-2048x580.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2062px) 100vw, 2062px" /></a></p>
<p>However, Google’s data-driven attribution can make some search terms look worse than they really are. For instance, our most expensive n-gram has a CPA of $17,377, yet it’s only spent $173. That’s because it has 0.01 conversions. Small fractional conversions can make CPAs and ROAS numbers highly misleading.</p>
<p>Additional filter criteria can help you narrow down your search, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Conversions &gt; 1 (as shown in the screenshot below)</li>
<li>Clicks &gt; 150</li>
<li>Cost &gt; $xx (depending on your account size)</li>
</ol>
<p>You can then sort by higher CPA or lower ROAS to find n-grams to evaluate.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/High-CPA.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11289" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/High-CPA.png" alt="" width="2059" height="636" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/High-CPA.png 2059w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/High-CPA-300x93.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/High-CPA-1024x316.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/High-CPA-768x237.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/High-CPA-1536x474.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/High-CPA-2048x633.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2059px) 100vw, 2059px" /></a></p>
<p>In this example, people looking for <em>‘today’s mortgage rates</em>’ don’t convert well. You could add that as a negative keyword or go further and examine the word ‘today’.</p>
<p>In the n-gram data for the past year, there has been a single conversion for search terms that contain the word ‘<em>today</em>’. That would also be a candidate for a negative keyword.</p>
<p>However, you can also look at the data from an organizational perspective.</p>
<h2>Organizing ad groups</h2>
<p>In the screenshot below, search terms that contain the word ‘<em>conventional</em>’ have an extremely high CPA. If we offer conventional loans, adding the term as a negative keyword might not make sense. Instead, it’s worth digging deeper.</p>
<p>Many of the search terms that contain ‘<em>conventional</em>’ are comparison terms:</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/conventional-search-terms.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11290" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/conventional-search-terms.png" alt="" width="2278" height="521" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/conventional-search-terms.png 2278w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/conventional-search-terms-300x69.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/conventional-search-terms-1024x234.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/conventional-search-terms-768x176.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/conventional-search-terms-1536x351.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/conventional-search-terms-2048x468.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2278px) 100vw, 2278px" /></a></p>
<p>If we don’t have an ad group specifically for comparing FHA and conventional loans, we could create a new ad group for those terms to see if we can convert them.</p>
<p>Once you add negative keywords, you will no longer show ads for those search terms. There are times when creating new ad groups is a better solution.</p>
<h2>Spotting new product opportunities</h2>
<p>This Adalysis customer produces personalized products. When they reviewed their n-gram data, they saw a lot of search volume for wine.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/N-gram-wine.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11291" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/N-gram-wine.png" alt="" width="1398" height="575" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/N-gram-wine.png 1398w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/N-gram-wine-300x123.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/N-gram-wine-1024x421.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/N-gram-wine-768x316.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1398px) 100vw, 1398px" /></a></p>
<p>They also discovered a lot of volume for custom-printed wine glasses, a product they didn’t offer. As a result, they made the search term ‘<em>wine</em>’ a negative keyword while they developed a new product line.</p>
<p>After several months, they removed the negative keyword for ‘<em>wine</em>’ and launched a new product to convert the searches into new customers.</p>
<h2>How to find n-gram data</h2>
<p>There are two primary ways of getting n-gram data:</p>
<p>There are several scripts that can write your search terms to a Google Sheet, where you can evaluate them. The biggest disadvantage of this method is that the search terms aren’t usually listed with the n-grams. It’s simply too much data.</p>
<p>You may need to use Google Sheets alongside the Google Ads interface for evaluation. If you have a lot of search terms, the scripts might also not be able to evaluate your entire account.</p>
<p>Some third-party tools, such as Adalysis (where these screenshots were taken), automatically create and evaluate your n-grams. This makes it easier to jump straight into your analysis. You can spend your time assessing and working with the data, instead of compiling your dataset.</p>
<p>Adalysis offers a<a href="https://app.adalysis.com/account-create.html"> 30-day free trial</a> so you can see how n-gram analysis can help manage Google Ads accounts.</p>
<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p>For your highest volume search terms, you’ll need to evaluate and decide what to do with each one. However, when evaluating your search term data at scale, nothing beats n-gram analysis.</p>
<p>N-grams make it easy to find and analyze:</p>
<ul>
<li>Negative keywords</li>
<li>Poorly converting terms</li>
<li>New product opportunities</li>
<li>High CPA search terms</li>
<li>Low ROAS search terms</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t just ignore your low search volume terms. In aggregate, you can gain many insights from them. Instead of trying to make sense of them manually, turn to n-gram analysis to make your search term evaluation insightful and quick to manage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you launch a new campaign, it can take time to gather enough conversion data to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Early on, it&#8217;s helpful to check that your campaign is bringing the right type of traffic to your website. Once you start to accumulate conversion data, you can assess your targeting and settings to refine the traffic as needed.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll walk through the key steps to set your campaign up for success. Let&#8217;s start with the most important data points to watch in the early stages.</p>
<h1>Weeks 1 and 2</h1>
<p>In the first week or two of a campaign, you won’t have much conversion data yet. Your goal is to ensure your ads are showing for relevant terms and bringing in quality traffic.</p>
<p>Here are the key things to check when your campaign first goes live.</p>
<h2>Search terms and n-grams</h2>
<p>When launching a new campaign, you choose keywords and match types that align with your products and services. As match types have become looser over the past few years, the most crucial thing to check early on is that your ads are showing for appropriate search terms.</p>
<p>At this stage, you won’t add many negative keywords yet. First, you’ll want to confirm that your chosen keywords match relevant search terms. If they’re not, the best next step is to refine your keywords and match types.</p>
<p>If most of the search terms are relevant, you can start adding negative keywords to block any that aren’t.</p>
<p>Since campaigns can quickly generate thousands of unique search terms, spotting trends in these large data sets can be hard. That’s where <a href="https://adalysis.com/blog/n-gram-analysis-the-secret-to-scalable-search-term-management-in-google-ads/">n-gram analysis</a> comes in — it helps you uncover valuable insights from your search terms.</p>
<p>N-gram data can help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand what search terms Google is matching your keywords to.
<ul>
<li>For example: keywords containing <em>quote</em> are often matched to search terms that contain <em>how much</em> or <em>average cost</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add negative keywords as necessary.</li>
<li>Find patterns among your search terms.</li>
<li>Look for high-volume n-grams that don’t have specific ads or ad groups. You can create new ones as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Net new impressions</h2>
<p>Make sure your new campaign isn’t just taking impressions and conversions from an existing one. It’s common to add a PMax campaign and see it perform well at first, only to realize that your Search campaign results have dropped.</p>
<p>If this happens with PMax and Search, <a href="https://adalysis.com/blog/seven-reasons-pmax-is-stealing-your-search-impressions/">read about the most common reasons behind it</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s less common with new Search or Display campaigns, but it does still happen. Take a step back and look at your account as a whole. Is your new campaign actually bringing in fresh impressions and conversions, or is it just pulling them from other campaigns?</p>
<h2>Impression share</h2>
<p>Impression share is one of the best metrics for increasing conversions.</p>
<p>In the early stages of a campaign, focusing on driving quality traffic helps set benchmarks for CPAs, ROAS, and conversion rates.</p>
<p>If you’re losing impressions due to budget constraints (and can’t increase your budget), try pausing some of your poorest keywords to free up more budget for your top performers.</p>
<p>If a low ad rank is an issue, focus on improving your quality score, landing pages, and ad group organization.</p>
<h1>Weeks 3 and 4</h1>
<p>Depending on your budget, it may take a few weeks to a month to gather enough conversions to start evaluating other settings and data points in your account.</p>
<h2>New and qualified conversions</h2>
<p>Just like with impressions, it&#8217;s important to check whether your new campaign is driving net new conversions or simply shifting them from other campaigns. Look at your account’s total conversions to see if they’re increasing overall.</p>
<p>Next, assess conversion quality. For lead gen, how many new conversions are sales or marketing qualified? If your sales cycle allows, you may also be able to track revenue back to these conversions and compare them to other campaigns.</p>
<p>For e-commerce, review metrics like the checkout amount, return rate, and other sales data. How do they stack up against your existing campaigns?</p>
<p>Depending on what you find, you can decide to adjust your targeting/settings or continue with your current approach.</p>
<h2>When and where your ads are serving</h2>
<p>New campaigns are often launched with the broadest settings possible. For example, they show ads all day, and target people both in and interested in your location.</p>
<p>Once you have some conversion data, it’s important to check these settings. Make sure to look at the data from a few different angles, too.<br />
For instance, in this campaign, it looks like most of the conversions happen between 9 am and 9 pm.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Conversions-by-time-of-day.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11264" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Conversions-by-time-of-day.png" alt="" width="2175" height="602" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Conversions-by-time-of-day.png 2175w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Conversions-by-time-of-day-300x83.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Conversions-by-time-of-day-1024x283.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Conversions-by-time-of-day-768x213.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Conversions-by-time-of-day-1536x425.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Conversions-by-time-of-day-2048x567.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2175px) 100vw, 2175px" /></a>Many PPC managers would conclude that you could turn off ads during low-conversion hours to save money.</p>
<p>However, the ROAS data shows that those off-hours actually deliver the highest return on ad spend.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ROAS-by-time-of-day.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11265" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ROAS-by-time-of-day.png" alt="" width="2173" height="524" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ROAS-by-time-of-day.png 2173w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ROAS-by-time-of-day-300x72.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ROAS-by-time-of-day-1024x247.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ROAS-by-time-of-day-768x185.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ROAS-by-time-of-day-1536x370.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ROAS-by-time-of-day-2048x494.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2173px) 100vw, 2173px" /></a>This scenario is common if a lot of competitors use ad scheduling, leading to cheaper clicks and fewer conversions during off-hours. Since most of our conversions happen during the day, but ROAS is highest at night, we should run our ads all the time.</p>
<p>As you analyze your campaign data, make sure you aren’t just looking at one set of metrics before you make changes.</p>
<p>The second key area to watch is location targeting data. Do people in your <em>targeted location</em> or <em>people in and interested in your location</em> convert at different rates?<br />
<a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/advanced-location-options.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11266" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/advanced-location-options.png" alt="" width="1869" height="466" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/advanced-location-options.png 1869w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/advanced-location-options-300x75.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/advanced-location-options-1024x255.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/advanced-location-options-768x191.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/advanced-location-options-1536x383.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1869px) 100vw, 1869px" /></a></p>
<p>If <em>interested in</em> is doing poorly, check where those users are actually located. If many are out of your targeted regions, adjusting your location options may help.</p>
<p>Based on the campaign type, other segmentations to review include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search partners vs. Google search</li>
<li>Mobile vs. desktop</li>
<li>Placement type: apps, video, sites</li>
</ul>
<h2>Match type effectiveness</h2>
<p>After gathering a few weeks of solid conversion data, it’s time to assess your match types. Did you start with mostly exact and phrase match and are now considering adding broad match? Or did you begin with broad match and need to add your top-performing terms as exact match?</p>
<p>Look at your data by match type to see if changes are needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Google-Ads-match-types.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11267" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Google-Ads-match-types.png" alt="" width="1766" height="699" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Google-Ads-match-types.png 1766w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Google-Ads-match-types-300x119.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Google-Ads-match-types-1024x405.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Google-Ads-match-types-768x304.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Google-Ads-match-types-1536x608.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1766px) 100vw, 1766px" /></a><br />
Ideally, most of your keywords should be exact match. If you have more phrase or broad match terms than exact match, we’d recommend copying those keywords as exact match equivalents.</p>
<p>Typically, exact match delivers the lowest CPAs, while broad match tends to have the highest. If you don’t see that trend in your data, it&#8217;s likely that you haven&#8217;t made your top search terms exact match keywords yet. Look at your top-performing search terms and ensure they also exist as exact match keywords.</p>
<p>If broad match is underperforming compared to your goals, focus on making sure your top keywords are in phrase and exact match. You can then pause broad match keywords with the most spend and the fewest conversions (or the most spend and the highest CPAs).</p>
<p>The goal with a new campaign is to train the bidding algorithms. These systems need to learn from your conversion data, so it’s crucial to feed them high-quality inputs. Even if broad match isn&#8217;t effective early on, you can test it again once the systems have had a chance to learn.</p>
<p>Throughout this process, continue analyzing your search term and n-gram data to add new keywords and negatives where needed.</p>
<h2>Bid methods</h2>
<p>The two most common bid methods for launching a campaign are Max clicks and Max conversions. They help when you just want Google to start showing your ads so you can get some data and optimize the campaign.</p>
<p>Once you have some conversion data to work with, you&#8217;ll often want to switch to Target CPA or Target ROAS bidding. Don’t forget to review your bid method to decide when it makes sense to switch.</p>
<p>If you are unsure whether to use a Max or Target bid method, this video breaks down <a href="https://adalysis.com/blog/learn-the-intricacies-of-target-vs-max-cpa-and-roas-bidding-video/">the differences</a> so you can make an informed choice.</p>
<h1>Wrap-up</h1>
<p>At a high level, the life of a campaign is pretty simple.</p>
<p>The first stage is <strong>planning</strong>. This is where you’ll decide on your ads, keywords, match types, and ad extensions before creating the campaign.</p>
<p>Once you <strong>launch</strong> the campaign, the priority is to ensure your ads are being shown appropriately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the impressions new for your account?</li>
<li>Are the search terms and n-grams appropriate for your products and services?</li>
</ul>
<p>Use your search term, n-gram, and impression share data to fine-tune your ad serving.</p>
<p>The next step is to <strong>refine</strong> your targeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the conversions are new for the account</li>
<li>Refine your location, time of day, and other settings as needed</li>
<li>Change match types or add new keywords based on your data</li>
<li>Use a bid method appropriate to your goals</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve optimized your campaign and are happy with the traffic quality, you can continue to refine or expand based on your long-term goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PMax and Search can work together effectively — if managed correctly. If not, PMax can cannibalize impressions from your Search campaigns, hurting overall account performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/blog/is-performance-max-cannibalizing-your-search-ads-a-deep-dive-into-search-term-overlap/">Our recent research</a> showed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>67% of PMax campaigns have search terms that overlap with Search campaigns.</li>
<li>When search term overlap exists, PMax has more impressions 61% of the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite this, when search terms are shown from both PMax and Search:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search campaigns have higher CTRs 65% of the time.</li>
<li>Search has higher conversion rates 84% of the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Search ad groups are structured so that your ads and keywords are highly related to each other and use a relevant landing page. This structure lends itself to high CTRs and conversion rates.</p>
<p>Conversely, PMax campaigns show ads for a wide variety of search terms. Therefore, PMax ads and landing pages are usually not as relevant to the search terms as in Search campaigns.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Note</strong>: These insights exclude PMax campaigns with retail feeds, as they behave very differently to PMax campaigns without feeds.</p>
<p>If your Search campaigns are losing impressions to PMax, it may be due to how your account is set up and managed. In this article, we’ll explore common reasons why PMax shows ads over Search and how to address them.</p>
<h2>PMax priority</h2>
<p>First, let’s revisit how Google determines which campaign gets priority in the ad auction.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/blog/is-performance-max-cannibalizing-your-search-ads-a-deep-dive-into-search-term-overlap/">In our PMax cannibalization article</a>, we explained how Google decides whether to show ads from PMax or Search campaigns. Here’s a quick reminder, as it plays a crucial role in managing search term overlap:</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PMax-Priority-Order.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11184 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PMax-Priority-Order-1024x536.png" alt="" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PMax-Priority-Order-1024x536.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PMax-Priority-Order-300x157.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PMax-Priority-Order-768x402.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PMax-Priority-Order.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the seven most common reasons why PMax takes Search impressions:</p>
<h2>1. Poor ad group organization leads to a low ad rank</h2>
<p>Granular ad group organization is the cornerstone of any effective Search campaign. When ad groups do not have closely matching ads and keywords, the quality score suffers, which leads to a low ad rank.</p>
<p>Many accounts fall into the trap of adding a large number of keywords to an ad group. Since these keywords cover a variety of ideas, to compensate, these advertisers create RSA headlines that include many keywords and aren’t focused on a central theme. However, since Google doesn’t always build the RSAs to match your keywords, this strategy leads to poor ad ranks.</p>
<p>Increasing your keyword’s ad rank can lead to Search campaigns getting more impressions for your top search terms. It can also have a positive effect on your overall outcomes: one company quadrupled their conversions just by <a href="https://adalysis.com/blog/the-biggest-mistake-with-rsas-is-your-ad-group-organization/">fixing their ad group organization</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Not adding search terms as keywords</h2>
<p>To ensure your Search campaigns are prioritized over PMax, it’s important to understand how Google matches keywords to search terms:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Exact match keyword identical to the search term</strong>: Search gets top priority.</li>
<li><strong>Phrase or broad match keyword identical to the search term</strong>: Search should show over PMax, as long as no identical PMax search theme exists.</li>
<li><strong>No identical version of the search term as a keyword</strong>: either campaign type can be used for a keyword.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we say identical, we do mean identical. For instance, if you have the keyword Italy tour guide, none of these search terms are considered identical:</p>
<ul>
<li>Italian tour guide (word variation)</li>
<li>Italy tour guides (plural)</li>
<li>Italy guided tours (word variation)</li>
<li>Tour guide Italy (different word order)</li>
<li>Italytour guide (missing spaces between words)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you see a search term consistently receiving conversions from a Search or PMax campaign, add that keyword to your account.</p>
<h2>3. Removing redundant keywords</h2>
<p>Google sometimes suggests removing redundant keywords.</p>
<h2><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/redundant-keywords.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11186 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/redundant-keywords-1024x265.png" alt="" width="1024" height="265" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/redundant-keywords-1024x265.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/redundant-keywords-300x78.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/redundant-keywords-768x199.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/redundant-keywords-1536x397.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/redundant-keywords.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></h2>
<p>If you follow this suggestion, the keyword will no longer be in your Search campaign. If the keyword isn’t in your Search campaign, then either campaign type can show an ad for that search term.</p>
<p>This is why we recommend always ignoring this recommendation.</p>
<h2>4. Google auto-apply settings</h2>
<p>When auto-apply settings are enabled, Google can automatically make changes to your account. Two of these settings directly affect whether Search or PMax receives impressions.</p>
<h2><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Auto-apply-settings.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11185 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Auto-apply-settings-1024x342.png" alt="" width="1024" height="342" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Auto-apply-settings-1024x342.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Auto-apply-settings-300x100.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Auto-apply-settings-768x257.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Auto-apply-settings.png 1373w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Removing redundant keywords can cause ad-serving issues.</li>
<li>Removing non-serving keywords — if a keyword doesn’t receive impressions in a while, then Google marks it as non-serving and recommends removal.</li>
</ol>
<p>This can create challenges for seasonal keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seasonal keywords may receive few or no impressions during the off-season.</li>
<li>Google removes the keywords as non-serving.</li>
<li>The following season, the keywords aren’t in your Search campaigns, so PMax takes all the impressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can confidently turn off the auto-apply settings and manually monitor Google’s recommendations.</p>
<h2>5. Lost impression share budget &amp; bid strategies</h2>
<p>If your Search campaign loses impressions due to a low budget, it becomes ineligible to show ads. This allows PMax to capture those impressions.</p>
<p>If you use different bid strategies for PMax and Search, the bids Google submits into the auction will differ, changing your ad rank.</p>
<p>When you don’t have a keyword identical to the search term, ad rank is one of the priority factors Google uses to determine which campaign will have its ad displayed in a search result.</p>
<p>We’ve seen many instances where companies know PMax doesn’t convert as well as Search, so they might set a CPA of $25 on Search and $50 on PMax. The higher CPA target allows PMax to submit higher bids, increasing its ad rank and likelihood of winning the auction.</p>
<p>This means allocating a sufficient budget to Search and monitoring impression share data is crucial for ensuring Search impressions aren’t lost.</p>
<h2>6. Other campaign settings</h2>
<p>If your campaign settings make one campaign ineligible to show ads, of course, the other will show ads instead. This is why we’d recommend checking that your campaign settings are consistent between Search and PMax.</p>
<p>The most common inconsistencies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Included locations</li>
<li>Excluded locations</li>
<li>Ad scheduling</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/campaign-settings.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11188 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/campaign-settings-1024x700.png" alt="" width="1024" height="700" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/campaign-settings-1024x700.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/campaign-settings-300x205.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/campaign-settings-768x525.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/campaign-settings.png 1071w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>In this account, the bid strategies, location targeting, and ad schedules vary across campaigns. This makes one campaign ineligible in some locations or at specific times, so that the other campaign serves ads instead. Since also use different, When these campaigns do compete, their bidding strategies use different formulas to calculate bids, causing variations in their ad rank.</p>
<p>Using the same targeting options across campaign types can help ensure your Search campaigns show ads over your PMax campaigns.</p>
<h2>7. Misspellings</h2>
<p>In June 2024, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ginnymarvin_today-were-announcing-updates-for-search-activity-7211746814113329152-7sRZ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAA6l0MBlEz1lANDXdb3Ffs7XrDRhchZRRA">Google announced</a> that they would combine misspellings with proper spellings in search terms reports.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/misspellings.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-11190 " src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/misspellings-1024x605.png" alt="" width="796" height="470" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/misspellings-1024x605.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/misspellings-300x177.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/misspellings-768x454.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/misspellings-1536x908.png 1536w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/misspellings-2048x1211.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" /></a></p>
<p>However, this has created a huge issue with PMax serving ads for misspelled brand names, even when brand exclusions are in place.</p>
<p>One of our advertisers — a large brand with a two-word name — experienced this issue. While we can’t reveal their name, we can use Papa John’s as a comparable example. Despite brand exclusions, the following misspelled search terms were triggered by PMax campaigns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Papajohns</li>
<li>Papa john</li>
<li>Papa Johns Pizzas</li>
<li>Papa John Pizza</li>
<li>Papa Jons</li>
<li>Johns Papa</li>
<li>Pizza Papa Johns</li>
<li>Papa Johns Little Rock</li>
</ul>
<p>This issue forces advertisers to reconsider older keyword strategies, such as manually adding every possible misspelling as an exact match keyword. Some brands have already adopted this approach to limit PMax stealing brand impressions.</p>
<p>While this workaround is effective, it feels like a step backward. Ideally, Google will address this challenge to provide a more streamlined solution. In the meantime, advertisers should consider experimenting with exact-match misspellings.</p>
<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p>Google will continue expanding PMax’s capabilities and pushing advertisers to implement this campaign type. However, many advertisers are hesitant to adopt PMax — or to try it again if they previously abandoned it — until Google provides more transparent insights into how these campaigns operate. Although PMax launched as a mostly black box system, Google has since provided a few more insights. Still, the extent to which advertisers will embrace it is up in the air.</p>
<p>Excluding Shopping ads, PMax often works well as a backfill system. Advertisers are finding success using Search as their primary inventory source and letting PMax serve ads across non-search channels.</p>
<p>However, letting PMax take over your Search ad serving often leads to poor results. To maximize performance when using both Search and PMax campaigns, you should ensure your Search campaigns serve ads in the search ad slots, while PMax is reserved for non-search inventory.</p>
<p>To give Search the best chance of serving over PMax, follow this checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add your top search terms as keywords</li>
<li>Organize ad groups effectively by aligning relevant ads and keywords</li>
<li>Do not remove redundant keywords</li>
<li>Ensure your Search campaigns have enough budget to serve all day. If they do not, then move budget from PMax to Search. (Please note this not does apply to retail feed PMax campaigns)</li>
<li>Use consistent bid methods, time of day, and location targeting options across Search and PMax</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Impression share is a critical metric for understanding your Google Ads performance. It shows how often your ads appear and provides valuable insights for optimization. However, when you run Performance Max (PMax) alongside Search campaigns, your Search impression share data becomes less reliable. In this article, we’ll explain how PMax affects this data and share strategies to mitigate the effect.</p>
<h2>How to use impression share data</h2>
<p>Impression share (IS) is one of the most useful diagnostic metrics in Google Ads. It provides a clear view of your account&#8217;s performance and opportunities for improvement. By analyzing impression share, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measure your share of voice</li>
<li>Identify potential budget increases</li>
<li>Raise or lower bids</li>
<li>Monitor your position against competitors</li>
<li>Pinpoint areas to improve your quality score</li>
</ul>
<p>You can analyze impression share data by keyword, ad group, or campaign. A quick review of the data can help you gain more impressions with your current targeting methods.</p>

<h2>How impression share is calculated</h2>
<p>Impression share is the percentage of times your ad was displayed compared to how often it was eligible to be displayed. However, there are some important caveats to understand before interpreting this data. This information comes from Google’s impression share <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2497703?hl=en">help files</a>.</p>
<p>1. Impression share is only counted if your ad is eligible to show.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IS-data1.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10897" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IS-data1.png" alt="" width="914" height="266" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IS-data1.png 914w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IS-data1-300x87.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IS-data1-768x224.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px" /></a></p>
<p>2. Impression share is only counted when your ad is competitive enough to show in an auction. <a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IS-data2.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10898" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IS-data2.png" alt="" width="902" height="140" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IS-data2.png 902w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IS-data2-300x47.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IS-data2-768x119.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /></a></p>
<h2>How PMax complicates impression share data</h2>
<p>If PMax shows an ad over your Search campaign, then Search isn’t eligible for the auction. This was confirmed in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ewhisper_questions-for-the-pmax-experts-1-do-the-activity-7214291481468043266-WRKs/">LinkedIn discussion</a> with Google executive Bryan Halicki.</p>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PMax-IS-vs-Search-info.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10899" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PMax-IS-vs-Search-info.png" alt="" width="739" height="282" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PMax-IS-vs-Search-info.png 739w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PMax-IS-vs-Search-info-300x114.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" /></a></p>
<p>As a result, your impression share data is recorded for PMax, not Search. However, with PMax, you can only see campaign-level impression data — not keyword-level.</p>
<p>If PMax shows over your Search keyword, that means your keyword doesn’t receive an impression and, therefore, no impression share.</p>
<p>Just because PMax can show an ad (meaning it was eligible and your Search campaign wasn’t) doesn’t mean it will. You’ll lose not only the potential impression but also the reporting for that keyword.</p>
<p>This affects many companies that watch impression share for specific keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand terms</li>
<li>Competitor terms</li>
<li>Top keywords</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Keyword-Impression-Share.png" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-10900 size-large" src="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Keyword-Impression-Share-1024x574.png" alt="" width="1024" height="574" srcset="https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Keyword-Impression-Share-1024x574.png 1024w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Keyword-Impression-Share-300x168.png 300w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Keyword-Impression-Share-768x430.png 768w, https://adalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Keyword-Impression-Share.png 1087w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>How this impacts impression share analysis</h2>
<p>Some Google Ads managers see their impression share increase while getting fewer Search impressions. While that may seem surprising, there’s a simple explanation:</p>
<p>To recap, impression share is the ratio of how often your ads are displayed versus how often they can be displayed. If PMax reduces your eligible impressions, they’re not counted in your Search impression share.</p>
<p>However, the most common reason for a higher impression share is a “max” bid strategy (clicks, conversions, or revenue). Since Search spends less budget on lost impressions, the bid strategy can increase your bids and lower your lost impression share.</p>
<p>This creates a situation where you can get fewer impressions and a higher impression share. (While that’s the most common scenario, there are many others.)</p>
<p>It can be confusing when Search campaigns have fewer conversions and an increase in impression share due to PMax. In an ideal scenario, PMax obtains the lost conversions, and the account doesn’t see a net loss.</p>
<p>In reality, PMax has a <a href="https://adalysis.com/blog/is-performance-max-cannibalizing-your-search-ads-a-deep-dive-into-search-term-overlap/">worse conversion rate</a> than Search. Therefore, when impressions move from Search to PMax, the account often loses conversions overall.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p>To track impression share accurately, it’s essential to add your top search terms as exact match keywords. This simple step will help you prioritize Search over PMax, safeguard your IS data, and ensure your account’s success for those search terms.
